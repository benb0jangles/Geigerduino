Here's a breakdown of radiation levels and their significance:  
Normal Background Radiation Levels  
Average global background: ~0.08-0.10 µSv/h (microsieverts per hour)  
Typical indoor readings: 0.05-0.20 µSv/h  
High altitude locations: Can reach 0.25-0.30 µSv/h naturally  
Granite-rich areas: Can see 0.10-0.40 µSv/h due to natural uranium  
#
Elevated (Worth Monitoring) Levels  
0.5-1.0 µSv/h: Above normal but not concerning for short exposure  
1.0-5.0 µSv/h: Elevated level that warrants investigation of source  
5.0-10 µSv/h: Significantly above background, may require reporting to authorities if persistent  
#
Concerning Levels  
10-50 µSv/h: Potentially hazardous for long-term exposure  
50-100 µSv/h: Areas with this level typically have access restrictions  
#
Dangerous Levels  
100+ µSv/h: Restricted zone level, significant health risk with prolonged exposure  
1,000+ µSv/h (1 mSv/h): Hazardous, requires protective equipment  
10,000+ µSv/h (10 mSv/h): Extremely dangerous, severe radiation hazard  
#
Context and Health Impacts  
Annual recommended limit for the public: 1 mSv/year (≈0.11 µSv/h if continuous)  
Nuclear industry worker limits: 20 mSv/year  
Acute radiation sickness begins: Around 500,000 µSv received in a short period  
CT scan: Single procedure delivers about 10,000-20,000 µSv total dose  
Chest X-ray: Around 20-100 µSv total dose  
#
When using your Geiger counter, readings around 0.05-0.20 µSv/h are typically normal. If you detect levels consistently above 1.0 µSv/h without an obvious source (like a known radioactive mineral sample), it may be worth investigating further.
